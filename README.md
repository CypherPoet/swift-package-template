_[[ A brief synopsis of this library ]]._

<p />


## Installation

### Xcode Projects

Select `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency` and enter `https://github.com/CypherPoet/MyLibraryName`.


### Swift Package Manager Projects

You can add `MyPackageName` as a package dependency in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    //...
    dependencies: [
        .package(
            name: "MyPackageName",
            url: "https://github.com/CypherPoet/MyLibraryName",
            .exact("0.0.1")
        ),
    ],
    //...
)
```


<!-- üîë UNCOMMENT IF REPO NAME MATCHES THE LIBRARY NAME üëá -->

<!-- From there, refer to `MyLibraryName` as a "target dependency" in any of _your_ package's targets that need it.

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourLibrary",
        dependencies: [
          "MyLibraryName",
        ],
        ...
    ),
    ...
]
``` -->


<!-- üîë UNCOMMENT IF REPO NAME DOESN'T MATCH THE LIBRARY NAME üëá -->

From there, refer to the `MyLibraryName` "product" delivered by the `MyPackageName` "package" inside of any of your project's target dependencies:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourLibrary",
        dependencies: [
            .product(
                name: "MyLibraryName",
                package: "MyPackageName"
            ),
        ],
        ...
    ),
    ...
]
```

Then simply `import MyLibraryName` wherever you‚Äôd like to use it.


## Usage



## üó∫ Roadmap

- World Domination



## Contributing

Contributions to `MyPackageName` are most welcome. Check out some of the [issue templates](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) for more info.



## üíª Developing

### Requirements

- Xcode 13.0+


### üìú Creating & Building Documentation

Documentation is built with [Xcode's DocC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc). See [Apple's guidance on how to build, run, and create DocC content](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc/api-reference-syntax).

For now, the best way to view the docs is to open the project in Xcode and run the `Build Documentation` command. At some point in the future, I'm hoping to leverage the tooling the develops for generating/hosting DocC documentation. (Please feel free to let me know if you have any ideas or tooling recommendations around this üôÇ).

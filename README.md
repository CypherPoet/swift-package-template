_[[ A brief synopsis of this library ]]._

[[ Optionally, a longer description of this package. ]]


## Features

- ✅ Feature 1
- ✅ Feature 2


## Installation

### Xcode Projects

Select `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency` and enter `https://github.com/CypherPoet/MyLibrary`.


### Swift Package Manager Projects

You can add `MyLibrary` as a package dependency in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    //...
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/CypherPoet/MyLibrary", .exact("0.0.1")),
    ],
    //...
)
```

From there, refer to `MyLibrary` as a "target dependency" in any of _your_ package's targets that need it.

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourLibrary",
        dependencies: [
          "MyLibrary",
        ],
        ...
    ),
    ...
]
```

Then simply `import MyLibrary` wherever you’d like to use it.

## 💻 Developing

### Requirements

- Xcode 12.5+ (Recommended)


### 📜 Generating Documentation

Documentation is generated by [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy). Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/realm/jazzy#installation), and as soon as you have it set up, docs can be generated simply by running `jazzy` from the command line.

📝 Note that this will only generate the `docs` folder for you to view locally. This folder is being ignored by `git`, as an [action](./.github/workflows/PublishDocumentation.yml) exists to automatically generate docs at the root level and serve them on the project's `gh-pages` branch.


## 🏷 License

`MyLibrary` is available under the MIT license. See the [LICENSE file](./LICENSE) for more info.
